Informer is a bash script that I made for personal use.I just gatthered all the command and tools I use during recon process and put them together.



Your brute is as good as your wordlist.
                                     -jhaddix

Uasage: ./informer.sh domains.lst


The domains.lst should contain only domain name

cat domains.lst
example.com
www.target.com
